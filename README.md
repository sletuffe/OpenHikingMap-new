# OpenHikingMap
OpenHikingMap is a mapnik 3+ map style using Openstreetmap data focused on Hiking. This style uses OpenTopoMap : https://github.com/sletuffe/OpenTopoMap as a base, extended with several POI mainly used in hiking/trail activities.

Missing external files can be found :

== geotiff files for relief, contours pg dump and Water Areas shapefiles ==

This still uses pre-compiled or data not from OpenStreetMap
You can get the one I'm using here : https://openmaps.fr/download

But of course you can build your own colored or not & shaded or not relief

== water polygons ==

== Help ? ==

Help is well apreciated to improve the style or suggest evolutions and since all the stack to make it work is a bit
complex to install, I can either provide user access to the server for sandbox testing, or event a Virtual Machine copy for local tests.
